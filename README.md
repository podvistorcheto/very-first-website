### Why this portfolio page?

The project tries to implement the mobile-first approach to achieve more user-friendly vestion of the page content. I have decided to do a portfolio site as it utilizes the effort to something practical which I can develop further. 
It also enhances the way presenting myself professionally. It is simplified portfolio version as it aims to refer to my current level programming abilities. 
The page targets recruiter and employers, hence it keeps things short. Such users don't spend much time in reading long text as it usually takes up to couple of minutes to glance over the portfolio. 
At the bottom contains social links for additional references and keep the content light.

### Features

#### Existing Features

##### Landing page

It includes active navbar consistent on mobille and desktop and hints the active language as the page contains also a version in Bulgarian which is mine native language. Makes the page accessible for users who prefer to see it in Bulgarian, especially in the skills section.
It provides also the option to switch languages as in case the user missed the option to spot the active language link at the top right of the screen. 
This feature makes the landing page more intuitive. 

##### About Me</h5>
This section has the skills and a brief text moto about me to present the current skillset. Here the Bulgarian version helps as the skills are better reffered to Bulgarian if a looked by recruiter in this language.

##### Contact Form

To make it responsive for the user it prompts a special message if even the first required field is not filled. The pop-up message informs the user for the purpose of the website. To avoid a dark pattern it advise the user to follow the linkedIn icon in order the contact form to fulfil it purpose.

### Testing

The page was tested on different browsers beside Chrome (Firefox, Safari and Edge). Thanks to bootstrap feature the it achieved relative consistency in the content whether the user chooses desktop or different mobile devices. 
One can spot a difference in the footer layout. Desktop version gives all three colums with full details and title text When user switches to mobile columns are reduced to 2, as the first one (about me) become reduntant. 
Title of the social links also becomes reduntant and it is removed to make the mobile layout easier to access for the user.

A minor detail that is adjusted for the mobile - added a media query to reduce letter spacing on mobile to make the 'ABOUT ME' appear on one row and still keep the designer approach to some extent.
